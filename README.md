JIT
===
*A not very useful wrapper around libjit ...*

```libjit``` is a library for creating Just-In-Time compilers, this extension wraps the library such that it's functionality can be called from PHP.

This library does not yet understand Zend opcodes, it's coming, possibly ...

This library exists because of boredom and is unfinished, it may never be finished but is fun to play with and I get to learn about the process of JIT in the mean time.
